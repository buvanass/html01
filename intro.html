    <p>“The simple perception of natural forms is a delight.”</br>
        When we think of beauty in nature,we might most immediately think of things that dazzle the senses – the prominence of a mountain, the expanse of the sea, the unfolding of the life of a flower.</br>
        Often it is merely the perception of these things itself which gives us pleasure, and this emotional or affective response on our part seems to be crucial to our experience of beauty.</br></p>
